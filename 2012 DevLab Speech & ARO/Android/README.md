This directory contains a beta release of AT&T Speech SDK for Android.  It includes instructions for installing the SDK and a programming reference.  Please note that this beta release of Speech SDK for Android should not be used for production apps released to consumers.  The final Speech SDK for Android will be posted to the AT&T Developer Portal in coming weeks, and that will be the appropriate library to use in production applications.
